# Named Entity Recognition (NER) System

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have Python installed (version 3.x).
- Install the required libraries by running:
  ```bash
  pip install torch spacy
  
### Setup
- Download the code repository from GitHub.
- Extract the contents of the zip file.

### Running the System
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/ner_system

- Run the main.py script:
  ```bash
  python main.py

- This will train the NER model using the provided example dataset.
- Adjust the dataset and hyperparameters in main.py according to your specific requirements.
- After training, the script will print precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation set.

## Brief Explanation of NER System
### Data Processing
- The data_processing.py module tokenizes input sentences and preprocesses them for model training.
- Named entities in sentences are annotated and converted into numerical representations.

### Model Building
- The ner_model.py module defines a simple neural network model using PyTorch.
- It uses an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM, and linear layer for entity type prediction.

### Training
- The main training loop in main.py optimizes the model parameters using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.
- Training progress is printed, and the model is trained for a specified number of epochs.

### Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation set, and precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

### Inference
- The model can be used for inference on new, unseen sentences.
- The main.py script demonstrates loading the model and making predictions on a validation set.
- Adjust the code and configuration based on your specific dataset and requirements.
